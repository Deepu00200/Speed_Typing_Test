# Speed_Typing_Test
The Typing Test measures an individual's typing speed and accuracy. The test-taker is presented with a passage and given one minute to type as much of the passage as possible. The test generates three scores: Words per Minute (WPM), Number of Errors, and Adjusted Words per Minute (WPM - Errors).
